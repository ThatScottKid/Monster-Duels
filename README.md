# Monster-Duels
C# Work-in-progress turn-based fantasy combat game - made in Unity 2D

# This project relies heavily on Unity's ScriptableObjects in order to create 'Heroes' and 'Hero' moves with ease.
To do this, in the project menu, right-click and select Create. You can then either make a Hero or a Hero move. 
Each Hero requires 3 Hero Moves in order for the game to function.

Once this is done. All heros must be placed in the Heroes array for each Hero reference. This is to allow for character selection
buttons to be created so that your own characters can be selected and work while the game is running.

#Float Variables
Float variables are used to keep a track of each players stats. That's: Health, Strength, Fortitude and Curses. Should be 8 in total.
